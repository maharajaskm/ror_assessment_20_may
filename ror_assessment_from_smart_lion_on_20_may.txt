Things to keep in mind

    Follow best practices for TDD. Watch this video to understand TDD better.
    Commit your changes frequently, ideally after every change to show how your code evolves with every step of TDD.
    We encourage you to use the programming language and tools best suited for the role you are applying for.
    Do not rush, take your time. We want to see your best work!
